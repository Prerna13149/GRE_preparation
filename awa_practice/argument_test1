The author concludes that Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to improve the employement chances of the students. While it may appear true, but the argument is rife with holes and assumptions and hence, it does not support author's conclusion that Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to ameliorate the employement chances of the students
First of all, the author mentions that students are at a serious disadvantage in the competition for post college employment due to University's burdensome breadth requirements. However, there is information about the kind of disadvantage students faced. It is possible that the disadvantage may be due to economic factors like recession and in this case, altering the curriculum will not be a solution to the problem. Hence, this undermines the author's conclusion that Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to improve the employement chances of the students. Inorder to strengthen the argument, author should provide more information about the kind of disadvantages faced by the students of the university.
Secondly, author assumes that the disadvantage in the employement is due to burdensome breadth requirements of the university. However, it is possible that the disadvantage is due to some other causes like recession, employers preferring experienced employees and so on. Also, author mentions about burdensome breadth requirements. However, author provides no reason for calling it burdensome. However, it may be possible that breadth requirement included various important courses. Hence, this undermines the author's conclusion that Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to ameliorate the employement chances of the students. Inorder to strengthen the argument, author should provide more information about breadth requirements and also reasons for disadvantage faced by students. 
Thirdly, author mentions that the job placement rate at Classen is lower than top-ranked universities. HOever, author does not provide exact figures. It may be possible that Classen's placement rate was 20% with a stength of 1000 while the placement rate of top-ranked university's rate was 50% which consisted of just 50 students. THis way Classen students were not at a disadvantage. Hence, this undermines the author's conclusion that Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to improve the employement chances of the students. Inorder to strengthen the argument, author should provide more information about about the exact number of students sitting for placements in Classen as well as top-ranked universities. 
Additionally, author assumes that the classes will be more attractive to employer if students spent more time on specialised courses. It may be true for one employer, however it may be possible that not all employers preferred students with specialised courses. Hence, this undermines the author's conclusion that University of Classen should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to ameliorate the employement chances of the students. Inorder to strengthen the argument, author should provide more information about different employers and their preferences.
After examining all the different angles of the argument, author is not justified in concluding that the Classen University should abandon or drastically cut back on its breadth requirements to improve the employement chances of the students.While the argument presents a possibility, more information is needed to warrant any action.
