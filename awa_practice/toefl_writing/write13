THe reading and the professor talk about zebra mussels. THe reading points out the damage these mussels cause to the ecological system. However, the lecturer presents ways that can help mitigate the damages caused by zebra mussel.
First of all, the passage asserts that mussels eaily attach themselves to bottoms of the boats and to water pipelines. This causes them to invade new areas and cause damage. Additionally, then zebra mussels reproduce rapidly and quickly increase in number. The professor suggests that decontaminatation methods should be adopted.The sea water should also be sterlised to kill zebra mussels. Also, since zebra mussels can survive without water for a few days, the professor proposes that anchor chains of the boat should also be decontaminated. THe professor feels that this would prevent zebra mussel population from spreading. In turn, this will reduce the ecological damage casued by zebra mussel's invasion.
Secondly, the reading contends that zebra mussels has very few enemies. So, it becomes difficult to eliminate zebra mussels. THe lecturer on the other hand, points out species like birds and ducks which feed on zebra mussels. SHe suggests that these species can be introduced in the area where zebra mussels are present. This will keep a check on zebra mussel's population. Additionally, she thinks that researchers should find ways to increase the population of species that feed on zebra mussels.  THis will also help in preventing the growth of zebra mussel's population.
The lecturer effectively provides solutions for each and every problem presented by the author of the reading.
