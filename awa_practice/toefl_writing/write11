THe author of the passage and the lecturer are talking about whether or not it is beneficial for professors to appear on television channels. While the reading claims that coming on television can prove to beneficial for not only the professor but also for the university and general public. THe lecturer does not agree to this opinion.
First of all, the reading claims that appearance on television can help professor acquire a reputation among other professors. THe lecturer does not agree this to this view. According to the lecturer, a professor going to television channels do not actually have good standing among other professors. They are considered not seroius in their research. OTher professors think that a serious researcher would rather focus on his work
Secondly, the reading asserts that universities also recieve publicity if their professor appears on television. Howvere, the lecturer challenges this view. Avccording to the lecturer, going on television takes up lot of time of the professor. The professor will spend time preparing for the speech and rehersing. IN this process, he will compromise on his research work, student meetings and other campus related work. THerefore, in lecturer's opinion, appearing on television is not beneficial for the university.
Finally, the author of the passage belives that with help of professor, the viewers of the television get to learn from the experts of the filed. HOwever, in lecturer's opinion, this is not true. The lecturer thinks that the professor on television, gives only a brief introduction to a topic which can in fact we be given by any television anchor or reporter. Also, television show producer does not want professor to say about serious technical and knowledge. Therefore, clearly, professors appearing on television will not ebenfit the viewers.
IN conclusion, the lecturer effectively challenges each and every point madee by the author of the passage.
