This topic raises the controversial issue of whether {main issue}.Indisputably, {admit some value in the opposite opinion}.Nevertheless, {provide evidence to refute the opposite opinion}.Thus, I generally disagree with the opinion that {opposite opinion}, and would argue that {main assertion}.

First of all, {assert a positive viewpoint}. I would like to point out that the {main support to the position}. To illustrate, let us look at the example of {an example}. In this circumstance, obviously {some observation}. Consequently, it is pretty obvious that {main assertion}.

Furthermore, {refute the opposite side, e.g. if .. not true, then ..}. Specifically, {look into one area to discuss the effect}. Both common sense and personal experience have told us that .... Hence, all the evidence above demonstrates that ...

Admittedly, {opposite opinion}. This is true especially when it comes to {specific areas or applications}. In addition, {further provide some support}. However, the above argument does not constitute a sufficient support to claim that {opposite opinion}. Because {some reason}, {main refutation}.

In conclusion, although {the opposite side}, {refute the opposite and give main support}. As long as some measurements are performed, or some areas are involved, {main conclusion still holds}. In fact, {extend the topic to broader/more abstract areas}.
