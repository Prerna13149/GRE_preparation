Questioning authority.ONly by questioning accepted wisdom can we advance our understanding of the world

The author presents a controversial view of whether only questioning the accepted wisdom will advance our understanding of the world. Accepted wisdom includes not only accepted theories in different fields like science, mathematics but also accepted notions, thoughts that are ubiquitious. I generally disagree that by not questioning the accepted wisdom, we can advance our understanding and hence argue that by questioning accepted wisdoms can we advance our understanding of the world.   
First of all, questioning any accepted theory clarifies doubts and improves our understanding. It enables us to get a deeper understanding of the subject and ameliorates our understanding. For example, a student questions the Newton's laws of motions, this question will lead him to other questions and which in turn will improve his comprehension of the laws of motion(given by Newton). Similarly, another student X questions the improtance of a custom in India where married women keep fast for the wellbeing of their kids. This fact introduced him to the orthodox belief followed in India and in turn improved his understanding of the world around him. 
Secondly, a person who questions accepted notions, tends to come up with better solutions to the problem. For example, Sam builds a car engine but due to some problem, the engine failed. Another person, Rahul, who wants to build a car engine, asks questions to Sam like how he proceeded in making the engine, where did he buy the components from and so on. This way Rahul analyses the possible reason for the failure and avoids making the same mistakes in his car engine. This way, asking question helps one to come up with better alternatives and reduces the chances of failure.
Additionally, questioning helps one to improve our innerselves. Whenever, we are in a dilemma, we question our selves to seek answers. Also, when we are pensive or contrite, we tend to question ourselves. We ask questions like "Why did we do this?Did we hurt someone?". This way, we analyse our mistakes and prevent ourselves from making the same mistakes in the future. Therefore, asking questions improves our understanding of both self and the world around us.
While the opposition may argue that asking the same question again and again may hinder progress.However, this can be negated by the fact that every question reveals new points and also, asking a question multiple times is better than repeating the same mistake. Hence, it is safe to conclude that by questioning  accepted wisdom can we advance our understanding of the world.
