While, it may see true that Super Screen company should allocate a greater share of its budget to reaching the public through advertisments, but the argument is rife with holes and assumptions and hence, not strong enough for the company to allocate more budget to advertisements.
Firstly, the author cites positive reviews are not reaching the audience as the cause for lesser people watching their films. Howver, it may be possible, it was due unfavourable time of movie release. Maybe the target audience, if students, had exams during that period or maybe, it was bad climate that prevented people from visting cinemas. This fact, undermines the argument that more budget for advertising will aid the company in increasing it's viewers.
Secondly, the author assumes that people decide to see the movie based on reviews. However, it may be possible, people decide on the basis of different criterias like actor, actress and genre. This fact, undermines the argument that increased budget for advertising and making the positive reviews will help the company in increasing it's viewers.
Thirdly,the author assumes that positive reviews imply that there is no problem with the quality of the movie. However, there is no information provided by the author about the content of the review. It may be possible that the review ignored factors like storyline, visual effects and was based more on the acting performances of the actors. This fact, underlies the argument that allocating more budget for advertising and spreading the positive reviews will help the company in increasing it's viewers. So to bolster his/her argument, the author should provide more details about the review inorder to support the argument.
Additionally, the author does not provide any information about number of positive values last year. Though a huge increase will be favourable, but it may be possible that the increase was too low. This fact, undermines the argument  and hence, author should provide more information to support the conclusion.
Lastly, the author says that positive reviews are not reaching the audience. However, it may be possible that reviews are reaching the people, but the reviews are not convincing enough to make people watch them. This fact, undermines the conclusion that more budget for advertising and making the positive reviews will help the company in increasing it's viewers.
Examining various angles and factors involved in the claim, the argument does not justify the conclusion that Super Screen company should allocate a larger portion of its budget to reaching the public through advertisments. While the propsal highlights a possibility, more information is required to warrant any action.
